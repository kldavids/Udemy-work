	<h1><em>My Story</em></h1>
	<p>
	A few years ago...I started to collect a few items of Rae Dunn.  Although I did not know what Rae Dunn was at the time.  I bought the coffee and tea canisters from Homesense because I loved the simple design.  A creamy white base with simple Black CAPITAL LETTERS. </p>
	<p>
	It sat on my counter for years...before I was introduced to the fact that I too had Rae Dunn.</p>
	<p>
	A friend was over for a BBQ and she pointed it out.</p>  
	<p>
	My friend has over 100 pieces of Rae Dunn she has collected....from mugs, to plates and bowls, as well as canisters and crocks.
