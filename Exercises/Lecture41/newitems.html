	<h3>NEW Rae Dunn Items:</h3>
	<p>
		I look for unique Rae Dunn ceramic items when I travel to the United States from Canada.  It is mostly to share with fellow Canadians but sometimes to keep for myself.
	</p>
	<h4>LARGE LETTER style</h4>	
	<p>These were purchases from my last trip Feb 2019 to Minnesota.  So fun to find Rae Dunn Pottery.  For those of you new to this....you are only able to purchase in the following stores -- Rae Dunn at HomeGoods, TJMaxx, and Marshalls in the US.
